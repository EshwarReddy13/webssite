                        My name is Eshwar Reddy Gadi, I am a junior at Texas A&M University working towards a Bachelors of Science degree in Computer Science. I am a programmer who is driven by a deep desire to work on something meaningful and impactful in life, rather than just pursuing a 9-5 job solely for monetary gain. Finding joy in meaningful work and making a difference is what fuels my passion. I am not bound by time constraints or limited to working just 8 hours a day; I am willing to invest the extra effort and go beyond those limits. Programming, for me, is more than a job - it is a passion that drives me to help others and contribute to something meaningful. <b>I love reading and sharing quotes, they motivate me to do what I do, so I've written a few quotes on my websites in hope that they will motivate anyone who reads it as well.</b>

                        <br>
                        In addition to my engineering pursuits, I share a keen interest in economics. My journey into the world of finance started back in the 10th grade when I started trading stocks. My experience in stock trading has had its fair share of ups and downs. From the thrill of pocketing gains to the occasional setback resulting in losses, each trade has been a learning opportunity. These financial fluctuations have taught me valuable lessons about the economics of businesses. As I navigated the intricacies of stock markets, I gained insights into budgeting, risk management, and investment strategies. These skills help me make wiser monetary choices in my everyday life. This passion can hopefully one day help me establish and run my own business. The knowledge and experience gained from my stock trading adventures will undoubtedly serve as a solid foundation for this entrepreneurial pursuit.

                            I started playing football in the 5th grade. This game has been an integral part of my life, and I have developed passion for it. In my homeland of India, I was competing at the state level, representing my region in top competitions.Football for me extends far beyond the boundaries of competition; it has a huge impact on my fitness regimen. As someone deeply committed to maintaining a healthy lifestyle, football provides me the opportunity to stay physically active.

                        <br>
                        I have a deep love for problem-solving, a trait that extends into both the digital world and everyday life. Whether I'm solving coding challenges on platforms like <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a> or tackling real-life issues, the thrill of finding solutions is what drives me everyday. My everyday routine revolves around solving various puzzles and challenges. I'm driven by a strong desire to help others overcome difficulties and simplify their lives. This passion motivates me to dedicate numerous late nights and early mornings to problem-solving. I understand that each problem I solve takes us a step closer to making the world a better place.

                    I have a natural inclination towards leadership. Over the years, I've discovered that I truly enjoy motivating people to achieve their utmost potential. People appreciate my presence because they know I can encourage them to reach their highest capabilities. I pay particular attention to my friends' emotions and try to look through their eyes (through their perspective) before judging anyone. Regardless of the team I'm a part of, my commitment is to ensure that everyone progresses in life together with me.                 </p>
