                        I've been involved in programming since my 9th grade, embarking on a journey that started with mastering Python and developing simple games like Space Invaders using Pygame. I continued to learn more and came across machine learning algorithms, becoming adept in utilizing libraries such as Pandas and TensorFlow. With these tools, I crafted algorithms for image classification and clustering, demonstrating my proficiency in the field.
<br><br>
Upon entering college, I took the opportunity to participate in the Tamuhack event, where my team and I engineered an innovative app tailored for insurance companies. This app empowered them to monitor and analyze their customers' driving behavior, facilitating more personalized insurance plans. My quest for knowledge extended to the world of data analysis, where I engaged in Datathon challenges, harnessing machine learning algorithms to solve intricate problems. Additionally, I created a Task Viewer website, which serves as a valuable tool for users to conveniently manage and monitor their tasks and deadlines. Through these experiences, my programming journey continues to evolve, fueled by my passion for innovation and problem-solving.

                    - Performed extensive data analysis on external datasets provided by Coursera to address a range of real-world issues, including office room monitoring and COVID-19 growth prediction based on weather conditions. This analysis required a deep understanding of data processing and interpretation, as well as an ability to identify key trends and relationships within large sets of data.
                   <br><br>
                    - In order to effectively process and analyze the data, I utilized a combination of the pandas and TensorFlow libraries, two powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis. These libraries allowed me to effectively manage and manipulate large datasets, and to generate detailed visualizations that helped me to better understand the data and identify key trends and patterns.
                    <br><br>
                    - In addition to this, I also implemented the K-means clustering algorithm to group temperature values and daily COVID cases. This allowed me to demonstrate the relationship between temperature and the spread of the virus, and to draw meaningful conclusions about the potential impact of weather conditions on the transmission of COVID-19. Through my work, I was able to provide valuable insights into real-world issues, and to help address these challenges using a data-driven approach.

                    - Developed an app that would track the driver's location, speed, acceleration and deceleration and compare it to the speed limits and traffic rules set by the government. Based on this comparison, the driver's behavior is analyzed and points are given.
                    <br><br>
                    - In addition to the rewards system, the app also provides regular performance reports to the driver that help them track their driving behavior and improvements over time.
                    <br><br>
                    - To ensure the security of sensitive information, the app implements robust encryption algorithms that secure the data transmission between the device and the server. The app also has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for drivers to understand their driving behavior, track their progress and redeem their rewards.                </p>

                    - Developed an AI bot using Python and Pygame. Its main goal was to find the shortest path out of the maze. In order to achieve this, the A* path searching algorithm was utilized. This allowed the bot to find the shortest way through the maze while also avoiding the enemy that kept randomly moving around.
                    <br><br>
                    - To further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the bot, a heuristic function was developed. This function calculated the heuristic value of each node, taking into account factors such as the distance to the end goal.
                    <br><br>
                    - By combining the A* search algorithm with the heuristic function, we were able to find the shortest path through the maze, ensuring that the bot reached the end goal in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. The implementation of the heuristic function greatly improved the performance of the AI bot.

                    - The data we collected from various sources such as customer reviews, sales data, and delivery information was processed using Celonis software and the pandas library. The software helped us to identify the inefficiencies in the pizza business process, including bottlenecks in the supply chain and customer complaints.
                    <br><br>
                    - By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we were able to find patterns in the data, which led us to make data-driven recommendations to the business owner. One of the key areas we found was a lack of communication between the front-end customer service team and the back-end kitchen team, which was causing delays in order processing.
                    <br><br>
                    - We suggested the implementation of an automated system to monitor and streamline the communication between the two teams, which significantly reduced order processing times. As a result, the customer satisfaction levels increased, leading to an increase in sales and overall profits for the business.

                "Success is not about the applause of the crowd or the recognition of others; it's about the satisfaction of knowing that you gave your best effort, that you stayed true to your values, and that you made a positive impact on the lives of those around you. It's about finding joy and fulfillment in the pursuit of your passions." - Anonymous            </div>
